# Reggies-Linear-Regression-Project
This was an off-platform project as part of the Python teachings in Codecademy. It was used to recap multiple modules of Python and (briefly) introduced the concept of datapoints recorded and accessed as "nested tuples". It demonstrates understanding of Python functions, loops and lists (incl. list comprehension).
This is intended to be a record of my learning only and not judged as a formal assessment.
